# Race day 2

I had skipped the Matariki classic since I was super sore and shattered and knew I couldn't do 3 hours of racing, especially since it was windier.
I actually ended up on Turaco, a trailer sailor owned by someone I know. We did ok, did 3 laps of the course which was nice, was pretty tough.

I skipped the first race of the day since I was still shattered from the Friday (24th) and tired from the day before
