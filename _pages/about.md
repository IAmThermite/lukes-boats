## Who are you?

Some small time sailor who likes boats. I just want to have fun mainly be am wanting to become more competitive

## Why does this exist? Why should I read any of what you have to say?

To answer the second question, which is easier, you probably shouldn't pay to much attention. Anything I say about my sailing,
or anyone elses for that matter, is probably wrong. However it should all be a bit of fun and I'll learn things.

To answer the first, this is mainly for me to have a bit of fun and try and track my racing performance and try and get better.
I'll post my own race reviews, other peoples insights into the races. Tips and tricks I've learnt so I don't forget them,
and other things that might interest me. Exclusively about boats though.
