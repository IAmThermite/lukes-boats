Another day sailing, absolutley stunning weather, but sadly still less than 5 knots.
The last little thing that I had to do was finalize the length of the lower forestay and finish splicing it off.
This was all pretty straight forward and now I'm super happy with the systems.
Next upgrade will be replacing the tramp so I can lead the lines through underneath.

## Going sailing

It was super light winds as mentioned but warm and sunny so I wasn't concerned about getting cold like last time.
After a bunch of rigging and fluffing around with lines (I was playing with the continuous lines among other things) I jumped on the water and set out.
The boat was suprisingly fast, much faster than I though it would be considering the wind.
Up one of the earlier beats I hit a puff of wind and out came one of the hulls out of the water. Wow was that exciting.
Feeling the accelleration and hearing the screeching of the boat was awesome.
This was short lived, lasted like 5 seconds before it splashed down again but hey, flying a hull in sub 5 knots is pretty sick.

I was out for about an hour and a half, mainly just practicing tacking and jybing. Still got a bunch to improve on but it isn't too hard.
I noticed that the top batten (which I knew was gonna be a problem) was extra stiff and annoying since it limited the batten below.
It was intended by the previous owner to close the top of the luff and drop some power but the sail would flatten out enough without the stiffer top batten.

All in all a good day out on the water.
