# Spring Series

I've been participating in some of the spring series sailing days whenever I can.
I'm still getting a hang of the boat but I'm still absolutely loving it.
I haven't done too well, finishing last all races but I can definitely see my improvements in the races.
I ended up doing an extra lap one race and spent 50 minutes racing but oh well.

# Boat improvements

I've finally managed to run my lines under the tramp. I used a pretty simple solution of tying some SHOCK blocks to the pad eye at each end of the beam
and running bungy under the tramp through the existing plastic hoops that are there.
It's totally transformed the deck and cleaned everything up and made it soo much nicer to move around.
